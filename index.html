          <h2>Why do I like creative Web Design?</h2>
          <p>
            I enjoy a friendly, approachable design known for experimental yet
            functional designs that feel fresh and engaging without being
            overwhelming or predictable. With a background in front-end
            development through SheCodes, I want to specialize in turning
            complex website creation into simple, impactful executions that make
            audiences feel seen. I'm easygoing and organized, focused on
            results, and committed to making the process fun.

            />
            <p>
              The Y2K aesthetic is sparking nostalgia for the 2000s' mix of
              cyberculture, early social media platforms like MySpace, and the
              rise of gadgets like the iPod. This era blended 90s alternative
              trends with digital culture, embracing emo music, pop punk, and
              online gaming, creating a bright and optimistic atmosphere for the
              new century.

              A friendly design studio known for experimental, but approachable
              and functional design. Their designs are fresh and interesting.
              One can probably tell I took a lot of inspiration from them when
              creating this page.
